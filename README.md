This is a minesweeper bot for http://minesweeperonline.com. The goal is to stick a top score on the all-time top 10 scores by being fast enough while escaping the site's bot detection.

Uses ctypes and PIL libraries in Python for screenshotting board state, moving mouse, and clicking.

Uses Bezier curves to simulate human mouse movement.

Work in progress!
